virus-checker-verification
==========================

Here, we have a script that creates some test files for your virus checker.
The files created by this script don't contain real viruses. Instead, they
are variations of the [eicar](https://www.eicar.org) file. They have to
be detected as files containing viruses by your virus checker but they
will not do any harm to your system - unless someone hacked this repo
and modified the creation script, so use on your own risk!
